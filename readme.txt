[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This modification adds two BBCodes to allow a user to float an image to the left or right of the text.

The two BBCodes takes these forms:
[code]
[imgleft]{url}[/imgleft]
[imgright]{url}[/imgright]
[imgleft {params}]{url}[/imgleft]
[imgright {params}]{url}[/imgright]
[/code]
where [b]{url}[/b] is the image URL and the optional acceptable parameters are:
[code]
alt={alternate text goes here}
width=x
height=x
margin=x
margin-left=x
margin-right=x
margin-top=x
margin-bottom=x
[/code]
Where [b]x[/b] is a number of pixels.
